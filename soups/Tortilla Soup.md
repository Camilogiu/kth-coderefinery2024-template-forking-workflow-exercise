### Tortilla Soup

## Ingredients:
# For the soup:

2 tablespoons olive oil
1 medium onion, chopped
3 garlic cloves, minced
1 jalapeño, seeds removed and diced (optional for heat)
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon chili powder
4 cups chicken broth (or vegetable broth for vegetarian)
1 can (14.5 oz) diced tomatoes (fire-roasted for extra flavor, if available)
1 cup corn kernels (fresh, frozen, or canned)
1 can (15 oz) black beans, drained and rinsed
2 cups cooked, shredded chicken (optional for vegetarians, can skip or replace with tofu)
1/4 cup fresh cilantro, chopped
Salt and pepper to taste
Juice of 1 lime

# For the tortilla strips:
6 small corn tortillas
2 tablespoons olive oil
Salt, to taste

# Toppings (optional but highly recommended):
Avocado slices
Shredded cheese (cheddar or Mexican blend)
Sour cream or Greek yogurt
Extra cilantro
Sliced radishes
Lime wedges

## Instructions:

# Make the tortilla strips:
Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
Cut the corn tortillas into thin strips.
Toss the strips with olive oil and a pinch of salt.
Spread them out in a single layer on a baking sheet.
Bake for 8-10 minutes, flipping halfway through, until golden and crispy. Set aside to cool.

# Make the soup:
In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and sauté until soft, about 5 minutes.
Add the garlic, jalapeño, cumin, and chili powder. Cook for another minute, stirring frequently to release the aromas.
Stir in the chicken broth, diced tomatoes (including the liquid), corn, and black beans.
Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer.
If you're using shredded chicken, add it in now. Let the soup simmer for 15-20 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.
Stir in the chopped cilantro and lime juice. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

# Serve:
Ladle the soup into bowls.
Top with crispy tortilla strips, avocado, cheese, sour cream, and any other toppings you like.
Serve with extra lime wedges for a fresh squeeze of lime juice on top!

Enjoy this delicious tortilla soup with all the comforting flavors you crave!
